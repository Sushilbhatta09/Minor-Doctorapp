#### Minor-Doctorapp
This is a minor project done in 6th semester during my undergraduate degree.
This project involves the development of a disease prediction chatbot that predicts diseases based on the symptoms provided by the user. The system is integrated into a web application that allows users to interact with the chatbot for disease diagnosis. Below are the steps involved in the project:

#### 1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize the project repository and set up the necessary environment using **Python**.
   - Install required libraries: **Django**, **RiveScript**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and others.

#### 2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Gather a dataset containing symptoms and their corresponding diseases.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's suitable for training the **Random Forest** model.

#### 3. **Disease Prediction Model**
   - Train a **Random Forest** classifier using the preprocessed dataset to predict diseases based on user symptoms.
   - Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it for better accuracy.

#### 4. **Chatbot Development**
   - Implement the chatbot logic using **RiveScript** to handle user input and match it with predefined responses.
   - Integrate the **Random Forest** model with the chatbot to provide disease predictions based on symptoms.

#### 5. **Web Application Integration**
   - Develop the **web application** using **Django** to provide an interface for user registration, login, and interaction with the chatbot.
   - Design the frontend using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for a user-friendly experience.

#### 6. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Test the chatbotâ€™s functionality and ensure accurate disease predictions.
   - Optimize the performance of the model and the web application for better user interaction.
 #### OUTCOME
